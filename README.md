# Breaking the System

I beleve my school district's filter is LIGHTSPEED so I tried breaking it and I figured out how to get an unblocked browser!

Open Co-Writer, click sign in with microsoft, then sign in options, then github.
Tap the Github logo at the top of the screen to get to the main page then tap the three lines 
on the right of the screen and in the search box type "[NathanNuckels/Breakthrough](https://github/NathanNuckels/Breakthrough/)"

Click these links. At least one always works.

[this link only works on my chromebook](file:///media/removable/MICROSD%204GB/DCIM/Breakthrough-master/index.html)

Have fun doing whatever!

But at the time of writeing, this leads to a 404 page so for now Ill just give you google. [Enjoy!](https://google.com)
